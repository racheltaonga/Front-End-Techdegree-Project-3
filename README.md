# FEWD--Project 3

An Online Registration Form

For this project I had to build a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I had to build a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach. 

I went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to: 

1. Further enhance the project by adding additional placeholder text for the other text fields. 
2. Add the HTML5 required attribute to input fields. 
3. Add a new background-color to one of the main sections of the site. 
4. Add additional styling enhancements to the form by adding transitions to the focus states of form field elements. 

Browsers tested for compatibility: 

1. Chrome
2. Firefox
3. Edge

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
